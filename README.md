# NHurl

## Description
NHurl is a package which incorporates the Orange-OpenSource/hurl binaries into a .NET package. C# attributes are added to ASP.NET controller endpoints. By including a Hurl test in the attribute, endpoints are more easily associated with the corresponding test.

## Compatibility
Currently NHurl is only suitable for Windows.
